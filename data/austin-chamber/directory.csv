658424,Austin Ketamine Clinic,austin-ketamine-clinic,Engage,"Austin Ketamine Clinic in Austin, Texas, is a family-owned and operated clinic with a compassionate staff that honors the principles of dignity, respect, and free will. The team opened their own ketamine therapy clinic out of concern for people who struggle with mental health disorders but can’t find effective treatment with standard medical care.

The professionals at Austin Ketamine Clinic offer ketamine infusion therapy for the treatment of various mental health conditions. Research has shown that ketamine has the potential to rapidly balance brain chemicals to alleviate the symptoms of mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In addition, ketamine infusion therapy has also shown efficacy for patients with Tourette syndrome and those who need help breaking an addiction to alcohol and drugs. The team at Austin Ketamine Clinic offers more than 100 years of cumulative experience, which they combine with a fierce dedication to establishing a trusting relationship that supports each person’s recovery.

When patients come to the clinic, they feel embraced by the staff and the peaceful environment. The location was specifically chosen to maximize the best ""set and setting"" possible.  The clinic backs up to Barton Creek Greenbelt, where patients are immersed in the sights and sounds of nature. The team purposefully created this environment to gently support each person’s health and wellness. 

Each patient has the personal attention of the team throughout their ketamine treatment, which goes beyond staying with patients during their therapy. The team stays in touch and monitors their mental health when they’re not in the clinic.

Ketamine therapy isn’t covered by most insurance companies, so the team at Austin Ketamine Clinic offers packages and works with you to help you afford the treatment you need, not wanting cost to impose a barrier to treatment.

To learn more about how ketamine can help treat conditions that don’t respond to conservative medical treatment or to discuss the costs, call the office or email admin@austinketamineclinic.com to schedule a complimentary consultation.","2525 Wallingwood Dr Bldg. 11, Ste. 200",,Austin,TX,78746,512-656-2187,https://www.austinketamineclinic.com,https://www.linkedin.com/company/austin-ketamine-clinic/,"Health Care, Counseling & Mental Health, Health & Wellness","328, 83, 132"

With the very finest technology available, and a caring and professional staff, we are dedicated to surgical excellence.

Dr. Dell’s consulting relationships with a variety of ophthalmic companies allow us to offer many new technologies, often years before they are available elsewhere. Through these relationships, we are able to offer the widest technological array of different lasers and diagnostic equipment available anywhere in Austin.


Our laser treatment suites are equipped with highly sophisticated Liebert environmental control systems. These industrial systems are used in sensitive computer data centers and microchip clean rooms. They are used to precisely control the temperature, humidity and air filtration system in the laser suite.

The importance of this might not be immediately obvious until you learn that even small changes in the density of the air in the laser suite can affect the outcome of the procedure. You will not find anything resembling this level of technology in most laser centers.

The excimer and femtosecond lasers we use in laser vision correction are incredibly sensitive pieces of equipment. Each one consists of highly sensitive optics, precisely aligned mirrors, sophisticated electronics and computer control systems. Even the slightest movement of the laser requires a factory technician to completely recalibrate the device.
