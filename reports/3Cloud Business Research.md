## Recent News

### Cognizant Acquisition (Completed ~Q1 2025)

Cognizant completed its acquisition of 3Cloud, making 3Cloud one of the largest Microsoft Azure services firms within the Cognizant portfolio. The deal creates what both companies describe as "one of the world's most credentialed Microsoft Azure and AI partners." Post-acquisition, 3Cloud continues to operate under its own brand with its existing leadership team intact. The Cognizant banner now appears on the 3Cloud website, and their logo has been updated to "3Cloud | Cognizant."

**Signal:** This acquisition shifts 3Cloud from a PE-backed independent into a subsidiary of a $19B+ global IT services firm, fundamentally changing their capital structure, go-to-market, and cross-sell capacity.

### MILO Launch — AI-Augmented Delivery Engine

3Cloud introduced MILO, an internally-developed AI-augmented delivery methodology. Key claims:
- Client onboarding time reduced by 90%+
- 40+ hours saved per issue via automated data validation
- $2M+ in cost savings and 4-month delivery acceleration for a major healthcare client
- Deployed across 1,000+ enterprise client environments

MILO encompasses five capability categories: Agents, Accelerators, Components, Frameworks, and Third-Party integrations — all designed to accelerate project delivery, improve quality, and reduce risk.

### Microsoft Partner of the Year — 2025 Americas US Winner

3Cloud won the 2025 Microsoft Americas US Partner of the Year award, adding to a long list of recognitions. This is their most significant award to date and signals Microsoft's continued investment in the 3Cloud relationship.

## 10 Business-Oriented Questions About 3Cloud

These questions are designed to probe 3Cloud's revenue model, growth strategy, sales process, and financial structure — particularly relevant in the context of their Cognizant acquisition and competitive positioning.

### Revenue Goals & Objectives

**1. What is 3Cloud's annual revenue run rate post-Cognizant acquisition, and what is the growth target for FY2026?**

Context: Pre-acquisition estimates placed 3Cloud in the $200M–$350M range (based on headcount, engagement volume, and PE growth trajectory under Presidio Investors). Post-acquisition, the question is whether Cognizant is managing 3Cloud as a standalone P&L or folding it into Cognizant's Cloud Solutions segment. Understanding the revenue baseline and growth mandate reveals whether 3Cloud is expected to be a high-growth engine or a margin-accretive integration.

**2. How is 3Cloud's revenue split across its three service pillars (Data & AI vs. Cloud Platform vs. App Innovation), and which pillar carries the highest growth target?**

Context: Hiring data shows 50% of open roles are Data & AI. Their marketing emphasizes AI, Fabric, and generative AI. If Data & AI is both the largest and fastest-growing segment, it suggests the revenue center of gravity is shifting from infrastructure migration (historically the volume driver) toward higher-margin advisory and AI implementation work.

### Sales Process & GTM

**3. How does 3Cloud's sales motion change now that Cognizant's enterprise sales force can cross-sell Azure services — and does 3Cloud retain its own quota-carrying sellers?**

Context: The Enterprise Sales Director role is still being hired under the 3Cloud brand, but the Alliances Specialist role hints at a heavier co-sell motion with Microsoft. The key tension: does 3Cloud maintain its own direct sales org, or does Cognizant's 300,000+ person salesforce gradually absorb the pipeline? This has major implications for deal velocity, deal size, and sales comp models.

**4. What percentage of 3Cloud's pipeline is sourced through Microsoft co-sell versus direct outbound versus Cognizant cross-sell?**

Context: 3Cloud was built on Microsoft relationship-sourced pipeline (both founders came from Microsoft, and the company was launched with thousands of Microsoft seller relationships). Post-acquisition, Cognizant's existing Microsoft partnership and cross-sell from Cognizant's non-Azure accounts create a third channel. Understanding the pipeline mix reveals dependency risk and growth optionality.

**5. What is 3Cloud's average deal size, sales cycle length, and win rate by service line?**

Context: Azure consulting deals range widely — from $50K assessments to $5M+ multi-year managed services contracts. Understanding the average metrics by service line reveals whether 3Cloud is a volume play (many small deals) or a strategic play (fewer, larger deals). This also indicates how much sales capacity they need to hit revenue targets.

### Target Audience & Market

**6. Is 3Cloud actively expanding its ICP beyond U.S. enterprise and mid-market, and does the Cognizant acquisition open international markets?**

Context: Pre-acquisition, 3Cloud was U.S.-focused with enterprise and mid-market clients (1 in 10 are Fortune 500). Cognizant operates globally. If 3Cloud is being positioned as Cognizant's Azure center of excellence worldwide, the addressable market expands dramatically — but so do the delivery complexity and margin dynamics.

**7. Which of 3Cloud's four target industries (Healthcare, Financial Services, Manufacturing, Retail) generates the most revenue today, and which has the widest gap between current revenue and addressable market?**

Context: Healthcare appears to be the current priority (dedicated marketing director hire, RCM Policy IQ product, HLS-specific platform roadmaps, 2024 HLS Partner of the Year). The question is whether Healthcare is already the largest vertical by revenue or whether it is an investment bet that hasn't yet scaled. The answer shapes where competitive pressure is most intense and where there is whitespace.

### Revenue Channels & Margins

**8. What is the revenue mix between project-based (time & materials / fixed-fee) engagements and recurring managed services, and what is the target ratio?**

Context: 3Cloud holds the Azure Expert Managed Services Provider (MSP) designation — an elite credential. Managed services represent the highest-margin, most predictable revenue stream. The company offers Managed Platform, Managed Data, Managed AI, and Cloud Spend Management. If managed services is currently a small percentage of total revenue, the growth trajectory toward recurring revenue is the most important financial story for the business.

**9. How does 3Cloud price its MILO-augmented engagements — does MILO create a premium over standard T&M billing, or is it used to compress timelines and win on price?**

Context: MILO claims 90% faster onboarding, 4-month delivery acceleration, and $2M+ in cost savings. There are two pricing strategies here: (a) charge the same price but deliver faster, banking the margin improvement internally, or (b) pass savings to the client and compete on total cost. The answer reveals whether MILO is a margin expander or a competitive differentiation tool — and how it affects revenue per engagement.

**10. What is 3Cloud's blended gross margin across service lines, and how does the Cognizant cost structure (offshore/nearshore leverage) change the margin profile?**

Context: Pure-play U.S. Azure consulting firms typically operate at 35–45% gross margins on project work. Cognizant's global delivery model (with significant India-based delivery) typically achieves 30–38% gross margins but at much higher scale. The integration question is whether 3Cloud's premium positioning (U.S.-based experts, 100% Azure focus) gets preserved — commanding higher rates — or whether Cognizant introduces offshore leverage that compresses rate cards but expands margins through labor arbitrage.

## Summary of Key Intelligence for Competitive Positioning

| Dimension | Finding | Implication |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Ownership** | Acquired by Cognizant (~Q1 2025) | Bigger balance sheet, but integration risk and possible culture/GTM shifts |
| **Focus** | 100% Azure — will not touch AWS, GCP, mainframes, or Oracle | Clear positioning; vulnerable in multi-cloud deals |
| **Growth vector** | Data & AI, especially generative AI and Microsoft Fabric | Aligns with market demand; expect aggressive hiring and positioning |
| **Proprietary IP** | MILO delivery engine | Differentiator on delivery speed and quality; not a product business |
| **Recurring revenue** | Azure Expert MSP; Managed Platform, Data, AI | Highest-margin segment; likely under-penetrated today |
| **Sales model** | Historically Microsoft co-sell dependent; adding Cognizant cross-sell | Pipeline diversification; but may dilute the "pure-play" brand |
| **Hiring** | Heavy Data & AI technical; limited sales hiring | Suggests capacity investment over net-new seller investment |
| **Industry bets** | Healthcare is the top vertical investment | Dedicated marketing hire, IP (RCM Policy IQ), multiple Partner of Year awards |
