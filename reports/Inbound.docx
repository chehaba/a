## Messaging Implications

1. **SharePoint** — Highest volume (25%+); use “migration,” “intranet,” “restructure,” “permissions,” “governance.”
2. **Power BI + Dynamics** — Strong demand; use “deploy,” “configure,” “replace reports,” “Tableau/SSRS migration.”
3. **BPO/Helpdesk** — 7% of inbound; separate campaign for MSPs and ops leaders.
4. **Industry hooks** — Government (SharePoint, Power BI), Non-Profit (Dynamics, SharePoint), Healthcare (compliance, dashboards), MSP (helpdesk outsourcing).
5. **Pain language** — Mirror “struggling,” “urgent,” “messy,” “end of life,” “lean team.”
6. **Size** — 74% are 1–500 employees; speak to “no internal IT,” “limited bandwidth.”
7. **Combo offers** — SharePoint + Copilot readiness; Power BI + legacy report retirement.
8. **Source** — PPC drives SharePoint and Power BI; SEO drives more Dynamics/CRM diversity.
9. **Titles** — Consultant (MSP), Director, Manager, Owner show up most; tailor by ask.
10. **Language** — Mirror “looking for,” “need help with,” “partner,” “guidance,” “build.”
