## Messaging

**Modern Workplace:** Use 03 IT Director Ownership or 04 IT Director Drift. Hook: "Most waste comes from 'nobody owns this system anymore.'" CTA: "Worth a 15-min check if you have any orphan systems or drift right now?"

**Marketing Services:** Use Marketing Creative or Attribution campaign. Hook: conversion leaks, attribution clarity, creative performance.

**Channel:** Email first, then LinkedIn. Austin-based angle: "Austin consulting firm" for local coffee/call.
