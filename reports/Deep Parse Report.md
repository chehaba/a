### Core Framework: Financial Expression for Enterprise Buying

**Thesis:** Buyer Commitee Targeting
- Increase revenue
- Protect revenue
- Reduce cost
- Increase capital efficiency

**Required sentence structure for every pitch:**
> "Can you answer how this offer will [increase revenue / protect revenue / reduce cost / increase capital efficiency] by [specific mechanism] resulting in [quantified financial impact]."
No? Move on

**Service-specific templates:**
| Service | Financial Expression |
|---------|----------------------|
| Data & Analytics | Increase revenue + reduce cost via decision accuracy, targeting, resource allocation → higher win rates, reduced wasted spend, improved margins |
| Power BI / BI | Reduce cost + increase revenue via visibility into performance deviations → faster corrective action, lower leakage, improved operational efficiency |
| CRM / Dynamics | Increase + protect revenue via pipeline accuracy, sales discipline, lifecycle visibility → higher conversion, reduced churn, predictable performance |
| Azure / Cloud Modernization | Reduce cost + protect revenue via infrastructure reliability, governance → lower downtime risk, scalability, controlled spending |
| Managed Services | Reduce cost + increase revenue capacity via managed model → freed internal teams, improved productivity, reduced overhead |
| AI / Automation | Reduce cost + increase revenue capacity via automation → improved margins, scalable output |

**Implication:** If a service cannot be expressed in one of these financial levers, it will not survive procurement scrutiny.
