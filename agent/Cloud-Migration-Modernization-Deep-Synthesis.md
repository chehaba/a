# Cloud Migration Modernization — Deep Synthesis

**Purpose:** Target companies undergoing cloud migrations for modernization. Affirma focuses on **Microsoft collaboration stack** (SharePoint, M365, Teams, Exchange) — not mainframes, core ERP, or Oracle DB.

**Source:** Targeting Strategy.md, Market Analysis Tables.md, prompts/Cloud Migration Targeting System Prompt.md

## Part 1: Scope Filter — What We Do vs. What Hyperscalers Cover

| Workload | Hyperscaler Focus | Affirma Focus |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| Mainframes, VMware, Oracle DB | IBM | **No — out of scope** |
| SAP RISE, core ERP | SAP, Accenture, Deloitte | **No — not primary** |
| **SharePoint, M365, Teams, Exchange** | AWS, Microsoft (Azure, 365) | **Yes — core service** |
| Power Platform, Dynamics 365 | Microsoft | **Yes — CRM, Modern Workplace** |
| Data harmonization for AI | Salesforce, Informatica | **Partial — Power BI, Fabric adjacent** |

**Positioning:** We help companies *within the Microsoft ecosystem* migrate and modernize collaboration and productivity workloads — so they can unlock AI, reduce TCO, and meet compliance.

## Part 2: ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)

| Criteria | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| **Company size** | Mid-market to enterprise (500+ employees preferred; 200+ acceptable) |
| **Industry** | Healthcare, Government, Manufacturing, Financial Services, Business Services (from win-rate data) |
| **Tech stack** | SharePoint 2016/2019, Exchange on-prem, file servers, aging M365 tenant |
| **Trigger events** | AI initiatives, compliance pressure, end-of-life platforms, M&A integration |
| **Geography** | Austin / Texas primary; national for named accounts |

## Part 3: Market Drivers and Messaging Angles

### Market Facts (from Hyperscaler Disclosures)

| Fact | Source | Implication |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 85–90% of global IT spend remains on-premises | Amazon, Microsoft | Massive reservoir of legacy systems to migrate |
| AI cannot achieve full potential on legacy infrastructure | Multiple vendors | AI is a primary migration trigger |
| 10% of on-prem support revenue → cloud = 5× revenue multiplier | Oracle | High incentive for providers to push migration |
| Real-time agentic AI requires data in the cloud | Bedrock, Azure | Compute, data harmonization, vectorized data are blockers |
| Manual modernization takes years | IBM, AWS | AI-driven tools reduce timeline from years to months |
| VMware conversions: 80× faster with specialized agents | AWS | VMware workloads high-priority (not our primary) |

### Driver → Pain → Affirma Angle

| Driver | Pain | Affirma Angle |
|--------|------|---------------|
| AI can't run on legacy | "Full potential of AI requires cloud" | "Your SharePoint/Teams data needs to be AI-ready. We help get it there." |
| Data silos block agents | "Agents need unified context" | "We help consolidate and structure SharePoint/M365 so AI can use it." |
| Manual migration too slow | "Years to months with AI tools" | "We run disciplined migrations with clear ownership — no migrating chaos." |
| Security / compliance | "Legacy = audit risk" | "Move to supported platforms with built-in controls." |
| TCO of on-prem | "5× revenue multiplier for providers" | "Reduce cost by eliminating server maintenance and support burden." |

---

## Part 4: Barriers to AI on Legacy (Pain Points for Messaging)

| Barrier | Description | Messaging Angle |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Inadequate Compute | Legacy hardware can't handle persistent AI loads | "Your infrastructure wasn't built for agentic AI" |
| Data Fragmentation | Agents need unified context; legacy = siloed | "AI can't see across your silos" |
| Lack of AI-Ready Architecture | Legacy ERP not designed for stochastic AI | "Legacy systems weren't built for agents" |
| Inability to Ground Models | No vectorized private enterprise data | "AI needs your data in a format it can use" |
| Operational Pace | Manual modernization too slow vs. AI innovation | "Modernization timelines can't keep up with AI" |

---

## Part 5: Named Companies by Vendor (Cross-Reference with CRM)

### Microsoft Azure / Dynamics / Copilot (Highest Affirma Fit)

| Company | Segment |
|---------|---------|
| Nestlé (1.2 PB), PwC (200K+ Copilot seats), Barclays (100K), Pfizer (25K+) | Consumer, Services, Finance, Healthcare |
| BMW, Bristol Myers Squibb, Coca-Cola, DocuSign, Equinix, Lloyds, UBS | Auto, Healthcare, Consumer, Tech, Finance |
| Avaya, Brunswick, Domino's, SoftCat, Verizon (Dynamics 365) | Switched from legacy to Dynamics |
| City of Hope, Mercy Health, Tufts Medicine, WellStar (Healthcare AI) | Healthcare ambient AI |
| United States Army (SAP + Microsoft cloud migration) | Government |

**Action:** Cross-reference these with CRM; flag those in Microsoft-heavy industries.

---

### SAP RISE / S/4HANA (Secondary — Look for Microsoft Workload)

| Company | Segment |
|---------|---------|
| Nestlé, BMW, Clorox, PwC, NYK Line | Auto, Consumer, Services, Logistics |
| U.S. Army (SAP NS2 $1B IDIQ) | Government |
| City of Charlottesville | Government |

**Filter:** Only pursue if they also have SharePoint/M365/Teams workload signals.

---

### Salesforce / Agentforce (CRM-Adjacent)

| Company | Segment |
|---------|---------|
| Pfizer, Takeda, Novartis, CVS Health, University of Chicago Medicine | Healthcare |
| U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, IRS, TD Bank, PenFed | Public Sector, Finance |
| Walmart, Costco, Boeing, General Motors, Ferguson | Retail, Industrial |

**Note:** Ferguson is Affirma case study (SharePoint). Look for dual Salesforce + Microsoft stack.

## Part 6: Industry Clusters — Fit for Affirma (Microsoft M365 / SharePoint)

| Industry | Evidence from Market | Fit |
|----------|----------------------|-----|
| Healthcare | Pfizer, Takeda, CVS, Mercy, City of Hope, Tufts | **Strong** — compliance, legacy EHR adjacent |
| Government | U.S. Army, IRS, City of Charlottesville | **Strong** — FedRAMP, sovereign cloud |

## Part 7: Cadence and Campaign Alignment

| Campaign | Use For | Hook |
|----------|---------|------|
| 03 IT Director Ownership | IT Director, Infrastructure Director | "Nobody owns this system anymore" |
| 04 IT Director Drift | Same | "Ownership + cadence before you move" |
| 08 IT Director Backlog | Same | "Reduce backlog, ship faster" |
| Enterprise Legacy On-Prem | CIO, CTO, VP IT | Strategic alignment, references |

**Channel:** Email first, then LinkedIn. Austin angle for Texas accounts.
