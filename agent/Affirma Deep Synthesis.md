## Cloud → Cloud Migrations

**URL:** https://www.affirma.com/cloud/cloud-migrations/

Disciplined cloud migrations focused on sequencing, risk mitigation, and operability for platforms more secure, scalable, and manageable. Moving to the cloud sounds straightforward until you account for the tangle of systems, dependencies, and political landmines that come with it. Whether you’re under pressure to modernize aging infrastructure or consolidating platforms after an acquisition, a poorly managed migration can drain resources without producing results. At Affirma, we help organizations plan and execute cloud migrations with discipline and precision. We focus on sequencing, risk mitigation, and long-term operability so your platform ends up more secure, more scalable, and far easier to manage than what you started with. We help you choose the right cloud services and configurations based on cost models, performance targets, and operational control. Our team works across Azure, AWS, and hybrid platforms with equal flu We begin by evaluating your current infrastructure, workloads, licensing, and internal skill sets. Our findings guide realistic planning, not wishful thinking. We create phased migration plans tailored to your specific business, security, and compliance needs. Each milestone is deliberate, achievable, and mapped to measurable objectives. After the migration, we fine-tune your platform for performance, cost efficiency, and maintainability. That includes decommissioning legacy systems, documenting the new architecture, and training y We design access models, configure identity systems, and implement policies that safeguard data without slowing down your teams. Security is treated as a baseline requirement, not a bolt-on feature. We move your systems including databases, virtual machines, file servers, or legacy applications into cloud platforms with minimal disruption. We account for interdependencies, refactoring needs, a A cloud migration is more than just a technical project it’s an operational shift with long-term implications.

## Cloud → Cloud Strategy Adoption

**URL:** https://www.affirma.com/cloud/cloud-strategy-adoption/

Cloud strategy and adoption grounded in operations. We define a model that fits your needs and guide the org changes to make it sustainable. For all its promises of speed and flexibility, cloud adoption remains an area where many organizations lose momentum. A disorganized move to the cloud often results in ballooning costs, neglected governance, and half-integrated services that no one knows how to manage.&nbsp; At Affirma, we offer cloud strategy and adoption services grounded in logic, structure, and operational experience. We help organizations define a cloud model that fits their needs, not their vendors’ sales decks, and guide them through the changes required to make that model sustainable. New tools do not fix old habits. We support cloud adoption through training, enablement, and policy development designed to help your teams operate differently, not just access different tools. For organizations planning broader transformation, we help stand up Cloud Centers of Excellence (CCoEs) to centralize standards, define operating models, and ensure ongoing alignment between business and IT priorities. We establish policies and controls for provisioning, identity, cost management, and security so your platform doesn’t devolve into a free-for-all six months after adoption. We help you evaluate public, private, and hybrid models based on technical fit, business risk, and long-term operating cost. The result is a strategy rooted in your goals not borrowed frameworks. A good cloud strategy accounts for more than infrastructure. We work across departments to understand competing needs, map decision rights, and set realistic expectations about ownership, timing, and tradeoffs. We help you categorize applications and workloads based on readiness, criticality, and impact, then develop a roadmap you can actually follow. Cloud strategy is not a paperwork exercise. It is the foundation for how your organization will operate and compete for the foreseeable future. Without structure, cloud adoption turns into platform sprawl, financial surprises, and poor service delivery. Our consultants approach cloud strategy with the same care and critical thinking that you apply to core business decisions. We ask hard questions early, document the answers carefully, and design operating models that do not fall apart under pressure. If your cloud journey so far has involved a lot of spending and very little structure, it may be time to reset the approach. Cloud strategy only works if it survives contact with reality .

## Platforms → Power Apps

**URL:** https://www.affirma.com/platforms/power-apps/

Power Apps consulting that blends creativity, control, and business logic to plan, secure, and scale low-code apps that solve real business problems. Power Apps promises low-code development for real-world business problems—but “low-code” does not mean “no planning.” Too often, organizations rush into app development without structure, resulting in tools that are neither sustainable nor secure. At Affirma, our Power Apps consultants bring the right balance of creativity, control, and business logic. We help you build applications that do what you actually need, connect to your existing systems, and hold up under the weight of day-to-day use. If you’re tired of Excel sheets pretending to be software, we can offer a more capable alternative—without overengineering the solution. We connect your Power Apps solutions to SharePoint, Dataverse, SQL, or third-party APIs, ensuring your data moves cleanly and securely across systems. Our approach respects both IT governance and business usability. A single Power App is easy to manage. A few dozen, developed without oversight, quickly become a liability. We establish best practices around platforms, security roles, and lifecycle management to keep things orderly. Replace outdated manual systems or one-off tools with structured applications that are easier to support and easier to use. We guide replatforming efforts with clarity and technical discipline. We develop applications tailored to your business processes, with careful attention to user experience, data structure, and maintainability. Whether it’s canvas, model-driven, or a portal solution, we match the approach to the problem. We design automated workflows that reduce manual input, increase consistency, and eliminate redundant effort. These automations are integrated thoughtfully, not tacked on as an afterthought. We equip your internal teams to manage, expand, and support the apps we build so you’re not left reliant on outside help for every update. That includes documentation, handoff, and practical guidance grounded in your working platform. Without direction, Power Apps projects can spiral resulting in tools that duplicate effort, ignore data policies, or create risk instead of resolving it. Our consultants bring structure to your citizen development efforts, without imposing unnecessary complexity. We understand how to align Power Apps with business needs, IT expectations, and user behavior. The result is software that works as expected, requires less support, and delivers measurable value across departments. Still running on workarounds? Let’s build smarter solutions.

We design platforms that streamline case routing, knowledge management, and omni-channel communication, ensuring your teams can resolve issues efficiently and with full context. Technology adoption depends on clarity, not just capability. We create and deliver targeted training programs that equip your users to engage confidently with Salesforce. From tailored sessions for executives to hands-on workshops for operations staff, we ensure the platform is not only used but used well. Salesforce is an investment, not a side project. Without clear planning, thoughtful configuration, and regular upkeep, it tends to evolve in the wrong direction, becoming bloated, confusing, or overly customized. Our consulting services help organizations pull their Salesforce platform back into alignment with how the business actually operates. We prioritize clarity over complexity, function over flair, and outcomes over dashboards that look good but tell you nothing useful. The result is a system that supports your teams, reflects your processes, and scales without imploding. If Salesforce is a maze of fields, tabs, and unanswered questions, we can help .

Research on customers, competitors, and markets; from qualitative and trends to personas and focus groups, translating insights into action. Great marketing starts with great insight. At Affirma, we dig deep into your customers, competitors, and market landscape with research that’s strategic, actionable, and refreshingly clear. From qualitative analysis and trends to persona development and focus groups, we uncover what matters, then help you act on it with confidence. Whether you’re exploring a new market, testing messaging, or refining your audience, our research services turn questions into clarity—and clarity into your next competitive advantage. Know your position and how to own it. We assess your competitive landscape, highlight white space opportunities, and benchmark performance so you can outsmart (not just outspend) the competition. How do people discover your brand? What makes them convert? Where do they fall off? We map the entire journey, revealing key moments of influence and friction to help you design smarter, smoother experiences. We turn piles of data into stories that stick. Our analysts can connect the dots between research, behavior, and business impact to help you deliver clear reports that guide strategy, not collect dust. Markets move fast. We track what’s next, not just what’s now, to surface shifts in consumer behavior, digital channels, and macro trends to help future-proof your strategy. Not all customers are created equal and your marketing shouldn&#8217;t be either. We identify distinct audience segments based on behavior, demographics, psychographics, and needs so your marketing can be personalized, precise, and powerful. We build data-informed personas that go beyond the basics. Think pain points, buying triggers, decision journeys, and content preferences designed to sharpen targeting and bring clarity to your messaging. We talk to your audience. Literally. Through panels, interviews, and focus groups to capture unfiltered feedback that uncovers what they’re actually thinking, feeling, and expecting from your brand. Need to validate ideas or align stakeholders? We design and facilitate research-backed workshops and surveys that surface insights, spark collaboration, and bring teams together around data that matters. You can’t market what you don’t understand. Smart research reveals where to aim, what to say, and how to say it. With a mix of market segmentation, qualitative analysis, and customer journey mapping, Affirma helps you uncover insights that spark smarter campaigns, better decisions, and fewer “oops” moments.
