# SDR Starter Guide — What to Do (Simple Version)

You’re new. That’s fine. This tells you exactly who to call, what to say, and what to skip.

---

## The Big Idea (30 seconds)

Right now, everything gets the same pitch. That doesn’t work.  
Instead: only message a few types of people, with messages that fit what they care about.

---

## Step 1: Tag Everyone in Your List

For each contact, add 2 tags:

**1. What department are they in?**

Pick one:
- Marketing
- IT/Tech
- Finance  
- Other (if you’re not sure)

**2. How senior are they?**

Pick one:
- C-level (CEO, CIO, CFO, etc.)
- VP
- Director
- Manager
- IC (individual contributor — analyst, specialist, engineer)

**Why:** You can’t write to “random titles.” You write to “Marketing Director” or “IT Director.”

---

## Step 2: Who Actually Wins Deals

From real results:

**Talk to more of these:**
- Marketing Directors and VPs (they win more often)
- IT Directors
- C-level and VP (they close better than Managers)

**Talk to less of these (or change your message):**
- Managers and ICs as your main target (they win less)
- Data & Analytics with a generic “we do analytics” message

---

## Step 3: When to Use LinkedIn

**Use LinkedIn for:**  
Marketing people + Creative work (ads, content, campaigns)

**Don’t use LinkedIn for (right now):**
- Custom Dev (software/coding work)
- Data & Analytics
- “Other” roles with generic offers

If a group isn’t winning on LinkedIn, more messages won’t fix it. Switch channel or change the offer.

## The 3 Campaigns You’ll Run

### Campaign 1: Marketing people about Creative work (use LinkedIn)

**Who:** Marketing Directors and VPs  
**Where:** LinkedIn  
**What you’re selling:** Help with ads, landing pages, conversion

**Message option 1:**
> “We usually spot 2–3 conversion leaks in 10 minutes. Want me to do a quick teardown and send you 3 fixes?”

**Message option 2:**
> “We help teams see what’s working vs not—and where spend leaks. Want a quick benchmark on your ads and landing pages?”

**CTA (what you want them to do):**  
Reply or book a 15-minute call for a teardown.

---

### Campaign 2: IT Directors (use email first, then LinkedIn)

**Who:** IT Directors, Directors of IT, CIOs  
**Where:** Email first, then LinkedIn  
**What you’re selling:** Helping them fix “no one owns this” systems and drift

**Message option 1:**
> “Most problems come from ‘nobody owns this system anymore.’ Worth a 15-minute check if you have any orphan systems or drift right now?”

**Message option 2:**
> “We help reduce backlog by bringing in a ready-to-run team. Want a 30-minute scoping call?”

**CTA:**  
Book a 15–30 minute review call.

---

### Campaign 3: Data & Analytics (use email only)

**Who:** Directors and VPs in Ops, Finance, or IT (not analysts)  
**Where:** Email  
**Don’t say:** “We do analytics and dashboards”  
**Do say:** “We reduce how long it takes to get answers”

**Message option 1:**
> “How long does it take to answer basic performance questions? We reduce KPI reporting time and create owner-based alerts. Want a quick ‘decision latency’ audit?”

**Message option 2:**
> “We fix the few reports that drive the biggest decisions. Want an executive KPI latency audit?”

**CTA:**  
Book a quick audit call.

## Words You Might Not Know

| Term | What it means |
|------|----------------|
| Teardown | A quick review of their ads or website to find what’s broken |
| Conversion leak | A place where visitors drop off before they become leads or customers |
| Orphan system / drift | Tech that no one officially owns or maintains anymore |
| CTA | Call to action — what you ask them to do (reply, book a call) |
| ICP | Ideal customer profile — the type of person who wins most often |
| Segment | A group of similar people (e.g., Marketing Directors) |

## Inbound Language (Use in Your Copy)

Qualified inbound leads use: "looking for," "partner," "migrate," "guidance," "build." Mirror that — say "partner" not "vendor." Top themes: SharePoint, Power Platform, migration, support. See [reports/Inbound Analysis Report.md](../reports/Inbound%20Analysis%20Report.md).

---

## The One Rule

If a group + channel isn’t winning (e.g., LinkedIn for Custom Dev), don’t just send more.  
Either change the channel or change the offer.

---

## If You Get Stuck

1. **Not sure which tag to use?** Check their title. Director/VP = senior. Manager/Analyst/Engineer = Manager or IC.
2. **Not sure which campaign?** Marketing + creative = Campaign 1. IT/tech = Campaign 2. Reporting/analytics = Campaign 3.
3. **No replies?** Check: right person, right message, right channel. One of those is off.
