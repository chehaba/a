# Cloud Migration Modernization — Targeting Strategy

**Goal:** Target companies undergoing cloud migrations for modernization. Affirma focuses on **Microsoft collaboration stack** (SharePoint, M365, Teams, Power Platform) — not mainframes, core ERP, or Oracle DB migrations.

**Scope:** Affirma's sweet spot = Microsoft ecosystem (SharePoint, M365, Exchange, Teams). Hyperscaler data informs *who is moving* and *why*; we filter for Microsoft-adjacent workloads.

## 1. Who to Target (ICP)

| Criteria | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| **Company size** | Mid-market to enterprise (500+ employees preferred; 200+ acceptable) |
| **Industry** | Healthcare, Government, Manufacturing, Financial Services, Business Services (from win-rate data) |
| **Tech stack** | SharePoint 2016/2019, Exchange on-prem, file servers, aging M365 tenant |
| **Trigger events** | AI initiatives, compliance pressure, end-of-life platforms, M&A integration |
| **Geography** | Austin / Texas primary; national for named accounts |

## 2. What We Offer vs. What Hyperscalers Cover

| Workload | Hyperscaler Focus | Affirma Focus |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| Mainframes, VMware, Oracle DB | AWS, IBM, Oracle | No — out of scope |
| SAP RISE, core ERP | SAP, Accenture, Deloitte | No — not primary |
| **SharePoint, M365, Teams, Exchange** | Microsoft (Azure, 365) | **Yes — core service** |
| Power Platform, Dynamics 365 | Microsoft | Yes — CRM, Modern Workplace |
| Data harmonization for AI | Salesforce, Informatica | Partial — Power BI, Fabric adjacent |

**Positioning:** We help companies *within the Microsoft ecosystem* migrate and modernize collaboration and productivity workloads — so they can unlock AI, reduce TCO, and meet compliance before (or alongside) broader hyperscaler-led transformations.

## 3. Messaging Angles (Aligned with Market Drivers)

| Driver | Pain | Affirma Angle |
|--------|------|---------------|
| AI can't run on legacy | "Full potential of AI requires cloud" | "Your SharePoint/Teams data needs to be AI-ready. We help get it there." |
| Data silos block agents | "Agents need unified context" | "We help consolidate and structure SharePoint/M365 so AI can use it." |
| Manual migration too slow | "Years to months with AI tools" | "We run disciplined migrations with clear ownership — no migrating chaos." |
| Security / compliance | "Legacy = audit risk" | "Move to supported platforms with built-in controls." |
| TCO of on-prem | "5× revenue multiplier for providers" | "Reduce cost by eliminating server maintenance and support burden." |

## 4. Target Company Lists (From Vendor Disclosures)

Use the tables in `Market Analysis Tables.md` to:

1. **Cross-reference with CRM:** Match named companies (SAP, AWS, Salesforce, Microsoft lists) against your account list. Flag those in Microsoft-heavy industries (Healthcare, Gov, Manufacturing, Finance).
2. **Prioritize Microsoft ecosystem adopters:** Companies on Dynamics 365, Copilot, or Azure are already in the Microsoft camp — easier to extend to SharePoint/M365 modernization.
3. **Avoid misfits:** Companies doing pure SAP RISE, mainframe, or Oracle-only migrations are not our ICP. Look for *Microsoft workload* signals.

## 5. Cadence and Campaign Alignment

| Campaign | Use For | Hook |
|----------|---------|------|
| 03 IT Director Ownership | IT Director, Infrastructure Director | "Nobody owns this system anymore" |
| 04 IT Director Drift | Same | "Ownership + cadence before you move" |
| 08 IT Director Backlog | Same | "Reduce backlog, ship faster" |
| Enterprise Legacy On-Prem | CIO, CTO, VP IT | Strategic alignment, references |

**Channel:** Email first, then LinkedIn. Local Austin angle for Texas accounts.

## 6. Data Sources in Repo

| Asset | Path | Use |
|-------|------|-----|
| Market tables | `cloud-migration-modernization/Market Analysis Tables.md` | Named companies, drivers, barriers |
| Enterprise motion | `outbound/Enterprise Legacy On-Prem Sales Motion.md` | Role-based messaging |
| Messaging Framework | `outbound/Messaging Framework.md` | Persona, channel templates |
| ATX best leads | `reports/ATX Leads Best to Target.md` | Austin contacts for MW |
| Opportunity data | `data/opportunities/Oops.csv` | Win rates, segments |
| Inbound | `data/Inbound/` | Ask patterns, company types |
