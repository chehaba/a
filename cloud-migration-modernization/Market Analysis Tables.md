# Cloud Migration Modernization — Market Analysis Tables

**Purpose:** Structured tables from hyperscaler/vendor disclosures for targeting companies undergoing cloud migrations.

---

## Table 1 — Market Facts and Drivers

| Fact | Source | Implication |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 85–90% of global IT spend remains on-premises | Amazon, Microsoft | Massive reservoir of legacy systems to migrate |
| AI cannot achieve full potential on legacy infrastructure | Multiple vendors | AI is a primary migration trigger |
| 10% of on-prem support revenue → cloud = 5× revenue multiplier | Oracle | High incentive for providers to push migration |
| Real-time agentic AI requires data in the cloud | Bedrock Agent Core, Azure, etc. | Compute, data harmonization, vectorized data are blockers |
| Manual modernization takes years | IBM, AWS | AI-driven tools (e.g., AWS Transform) reduce timeline from years to months |
| VMware conversions: 80× faster with specialized agents | AWS | VMware workloads are high-priority target |

## Table 2 — Legacy System Targets (Priority for Hyperscalers)

| Target Type | Key Vendors | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Mainframes | AWS, IBM | AWS Transform; IBM z17 as bridge to hybrid cloud |
| VMware Workloads | AWS, Microsoft | High-priority conversion; specialized agents |
| ERP (On-Prem) | Microsoft, SAP | Nestlé: 200+ SAP instances, 10K servers migrated; RISE with SAP |
| Databases (Oracle, SQL Server) | Oracle, Microsoft | Oracle multicloud revenue +817% YoY; Azure for Oracle workloads |
| .NET Windows Apps | Microsoft | Convert to .NET Linux → up to 40% licensing cost reduction |
| Industrial / Government | SAP, Microsoft, AWS | U.S. Army $1B contract; SAP NS2 FedRAMP |

## Table 3 — Barriers to AI on Legacy (Pain Points for Messaging)

| Barrier | Description | Messaging Angle |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Inadequate Compute | Legacy hardware can't handle persistent high-intensity AI loads | "Your infrastructure wasn't built for agentic AI" |
| Data Fragmentation | Agents need unified context; legacy = siloed data | "AI can't see across your silos" |
| Lack of AI-Ready Architecture | Legacy ERP not designed for stochastic AI | "Legacy systems weren't built for agents" |
| Inability to Ground Models | No vectorized private enterprise data | "AI needs your data in a format it can use" |
| Operational Pace | Manual modernization too slow vs. AI innovation | "Modernization timelines can't keep up with AI" |
