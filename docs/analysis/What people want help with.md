## Plain-Language Takeaways

- **SharePoint and Power BI** drive the most inbound — intranets, migrations, dashboards, and governance.
- **Migration work** is common — Google → M365, file servers → SharePoint, Tableau/SSRS → Power BI.
- **SMB and mid-market** — many leads reference small teams, limited IT, and concerns about cost and simplicity.

## Messaging Angles That Match the Data

1. “Intranet refresh / classic → modern SharePoint”
2. “File server or Box to SharePoint migration”
3. “Power BI dashboards without heavy custom dev”
4. “Getting more out of M365 instead of new tools”
5. “HubSpot setup, cleanup, and workflows”
6. “AI strategy: where to start and what to prioritize”
