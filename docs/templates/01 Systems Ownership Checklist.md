# Systems Ownership Checklist

Use this when you have 5 minutes. Check each system/app; if anything feels off, you'll know where to look.

---

## For each critical system or app:

| System / App | Who owns it? | When was it last reviewed? | Is it documented? |
|--------------|--------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| 1. | | | ☐ Yes ☐ No |
| 2. | | | ☐ Yes ☐ No |
| 3. | | | ☐ Yes ☐ No |
| 4. | | | ☐ Yes ☐ No |
| 5. | | | ☐ Yes ☐ No |

## Red flags (drift signals)

- [ ] No clear owner for 6+ months
- [ ] Multiple people "own" it but no single point of contact
- [ ] No one has logged in or made changes in 90+ days
- [ ] Documentation is outdated or missing
- [ ] Integrations or dependencies are unclear
- [ ] Runbook for outages doesn't exist or is stale

## Quick action

If 2+ red flags apply to a system, schedule a 30-min review with stakeholders to assign ownership and set a review cadence.
