## Answer for your team or function:

1. **How long does it take to answer: "What did we close last month?"**  
   ___ hours / days / not available

2. **How long does it take to answer: "Which campaigns drove the most pipeline?"**  
   ___ hours / days / not available

3. **How long does it take to answer: "What's our current pipeline by stage?"**  
   ___ hours / days / not available

## Score

- **&lt; 1 hour** for each = green

## Where answers get stuck

For any red or yellow: Is it data gathering, manual work, waiting on others, or tool/access?
