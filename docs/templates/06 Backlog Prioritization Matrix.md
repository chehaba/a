# Backlog Prioritization Matrix

Use this to decide what to push to a partner vs keep in-house.

---

## Axes

**Effort:** Low (1–2 weeks) | Medium (1–2 months) | High (3+ months)  
**Impact:** Low | Medium | High

---

## Matrix

| | Low effort | Medium effort | High effort |
|---|------------|---------------|-------------|
| **High impact** | Do in-house (quick win) | Partner or in-house (evaluate capacity) | Partner (if no internal bandwidth) |
| **Medium impact** | Do in-house | Do in-house or defer | Partner (if strategic) |
| **Low impact** | Defer or deprioritize | Defer | Don't do |

## How to use

1. List top 10 backlog items.
2. Score each: effort (1–3) and impact (1–3).
3. Plot on matrix.
4. For "Partner" quadrant: scope clearly, define outputs, get fixed-price or capped estimate.
5. For "Do in-house": assign owner and sprint.
6. For "Defer": document why and revisit in 90 days.
