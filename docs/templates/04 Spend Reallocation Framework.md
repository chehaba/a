# Spend Reallocation Framework

Four questions to see where spend leaks vs where it converts.

---

## Question 1: Attribution

**Can you attribute revenue or pipeline to each channel?**

| Channel | Attributed revenue/pipeline? | Confidence |
|---------|----------------------------|------------|
| Paid search | ☐ Yes ☐ Partial ☐ No | Low / Med / High |
| Paid social | ☐ Yes ☐ Partial ☐ No | |
| Organic / SEO | ☐ Yes ☐ Partial ☐ No | |
| Email | ☐ Yes ☐ Partial ☐ No | |
| Events / webinars | ☐ Yes ☐ Partial ☐ No | |
| Other: _______ | ☐ Yes ☐ Partial ☐ No | |

**Score:** Full attribution = 3, Partial = 2, No = 1. Sum across channels. Higher = less leak.

## Question 2: Conversion by stage

**Where do leads drop off?**

| Stage | Conversion rate | Bottleneck? |
|-------|------------------|-------------|
| Visit → Lead | _____% | ☐ Yes ☐ No |
| Lead → MQL | _____% | ☐ Yes ☐ No |
| MQL → Opportunity | _____% | ☐ Yes ☐ No |
| Opportunity → Closed | _____% | ☐ Yes ☐ No |

**Focus:** Lowest conversion stage is usually the leak.

## Question 3: Spend vs outcome

**For each paid channel, what's cost per [lead / MQL / opp]?**

| Channel | Monthly spend | Cost per outcome | Trend |
|---------|---------------|------------------|-------|
| | $ | $ | ↑ ↓ → |
| | $ | $ | |
| | $ | $ | |

**Signal:** Channels with rising cost or falling conversion = reallocation candidates.

## Question 4: Decision cadence

**How often do you reallocate budget based on data?**

- [ ] Weekly
- [ ] Monthly
- [ ] Quarterly
- [ ] Rarely / never

**Target:** Monthly at minimum. Faster = less wasted spend.
