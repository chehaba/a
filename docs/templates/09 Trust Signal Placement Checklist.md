# Trust Signal Placement Checklist

Where to put social proof, logos, and reassurance so they support conversion without cluttering the page.

---

## Above the fold

| Element | Placement | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Logo bar (customers, partners) | Just below headline or next to CTA | 3–6 logos max |
| "X companies use us" | Near primary CTA | Use real number |
| Star rating or review snippet | Adjacent to form | If you have them |

---

## Near the form

| Element | Placement | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| "We won't spam" / privacy | Below or beside submit | Reduces friction |
| Security badge (SSL, etc.) | Near submit button | If relevant |
| Guarantee or refund | Below CTA | If applicable |

---

## Below the fold

| Element | Placement | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Full case study or testimonial | After primary CTA | For scanners |
| FAQ | Mid-page or bottom | Address objections |
| Full logo strip | Footer or end | Optional |

---

## Avoid

- Too many logos (dilutes impact)
- Fake or outdated social proof
- Trust signals far from CTA (out of sight when deciding)
- Generic "As seen in" with unrelated brands

**Quick action:** Add at least one trust signal above the fold and one near the form. Test placement with A/B if possible.
